  abstract = {This paper contains the development of an analytical basis for the St. Clair line loadability curve and presents the extension of its use into the EHV and UHV transmission area. A brief historical background describes the origin and pertinent aspects of the St. Clair curve including the fact that the old curve, originally intended for transmission voltages up to 330-kV, is derived empirically based upon practical considerations and experience. In order to extend the usefulness of such line loadability characteristics into the EHV and UHV range, a simplified representation of the system, which incorporates flexibility to include both line and system parameters, is utilized to compute maximum line loadability subject to assumed system performance criteria. It is shown that, for a reasonable and consistent set of assumptions, with regard to system parameters and performance criteria, EHV and UHV transmission line loadability characteristics are nearly identical to the original St. Clair curve. The paper further illustrates the relative influence of these assumptions on the derived characteristics, In particular, the electrical strength of the sending- and receiving-end systems is found to have an increasingly important influence on the loadability of transmission lines as the voltage class increases. The analytical approach to determination of transmission line loadability curves enables the user to examine specific situations and assumptions and to avoid possible misinterpretation of generalized conceptual guides-particularly in the EHV/UHV range where system parameters can have a significant impact on loadability.},

First, in this contribution the importance and availability issues of grid data in the context of energy system modelling are highlighted. Second, this paper focuses on power grid modelling based on open and publicly available data from OpenStreetMap using open source software tools. Two recent approaches developed to build electrical transmission network models using openly available data sources are presented and discussed. The proposed methods provide transparent assumptions, simplifications and documentation of grid modelling. This results in the ability of scientists and other stakeholders to validate, discuss or reproduce the results of energy system models. Thus the new open approaches offer a unique opportunity to increase transparency, comparability and reproducibility of results in energy system modelling.},

  abstract = {The North American power grid is one of the most complex technological networks, and its interconnectivity allows both for long-distance power transmission and for the propagation of disturbances. We model the power grid using its actual topology and plausible assumptions about the load and overload of transmission substations. Our results indicate that the loss of a single substation can result in up to 25{\%} loss of transmission efficiency by triggering an overload cascade in the network. The actual transmission loss depends on the overload tolerance of the network and the connectivity of the failed substation. We systematically study the damage inflicted by the loss of single nodes, and find three universal behaviors, suggesting that 40{\%} of the transmission substations lead to cascading failures when disrupted. While the loss of a single node can inflict substantial damage, subsequent removals have only incremental effects, in agreement with the topological resilience to less than 1{\%} node loss.

  abstract = {In a cascading power transmission outage, component outages propagate non-locally; after one component outages, the next failure may be very distant, both topologically and geographically. As a result, simple models of topological contagion do not accurately represent the propagation of cascades in power systems. However, cascading power outages do follow patterns, some of which are useful in understanding and reducing blackout risk. This paper describes a method by which the data from many cascading failure simulations can be transformed into a graph-based model of influences that provides actionable information about the many ways that cascades propagate in a particular system. The resulting {"}influence graph{"} model is Markovian, since component outage probabilities depend only on the outages that occurred in the prior generation. To validate the model we compare the distribution of cascade sizes resulting from n-2 contingencies in a 2896 branch test case to cascade sizes in the influence graph. The two distributions are remarkably similar. In addition, we derive an equation with which one can quickly identify modifications to the proposed system that will substantially reduce cascade propagation. With this equation one can quickly identify critical components that can be improved to substantially reduce the risk of large cascading blackouts.},

  abstract = {Using data from the North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC) for 1984-2006, we find several trends. We find that the frequency of large blackouts in the United States has not decreased over time, that there is a statistically significant increase in blackout frequency during peak hours of the day and during late summer and mid-winter months (although non-storm-related risk is nearly constant through the year) and that there is strong statistical support for the previously observed power-law statistical relationship between blackout size and frequency. We do not find that blackout sizes and blackout durations are significantly correlated. These trends hold even after controlling for increasing demand and population and after eliminating small events, for which the data may be skewed by spotty reporting. Trends in blackout occurrences, such as those observed in the North American data, have important implications for those who make investment and policy decisions in the electricity industry. We provide a number of examples that illustrate how these trends can inform benefit-cost analysis calculations. Also, following procedures used in natural disaster planning we use the observed statistical trends to calculate the size of the 100-year blackout, which for North America is 186,000 MW. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {We give a comprehensive account of a complex systems ap-proach to large blackouts caused by cascading failure. In-stead of looking at the details of particular blackouts, we study the statistics, dynamics and risk of series of blackouts with approximate global models. North American blackout data suggests that the frequency of large blackouts is gov-erned by a power law. This result is consistent with the power system being a complex system designed and oper-ated near criticality. The power law makes the risk of large blackouts consequential and implies the need for nonstan-dard risk analysis. Power system overall load relative to operating limits is a key factor affecting the risk of cascading failure. Blackout models and an abstract model of cascading failure show that there are critical transitions as load is increased. Power law behavior can be observed at these transitions. The critical loads at which blackout risk sharply increases are identifiable thresholds for cascading failure and we dis-cuss approaches to computing the proximity to cascading failure using these thresholds. Approximating cascading failure as a branching process suggests ways to compute and monitor criticality by quantifying how much failures propagate. Inspired by concepts from self-organized criticality, we sug-gest that power system operating margins evolve slowly to near criticality and confirm this idea using a blackout model. Mitigation of blackout risk should take care to ac-count for counter-intuitive effects in complex self-organized critical systems. For example, suppressing small blackouts could lead the system to be operated closer to the edge and ultimately increase the risk of large blackouts.},

The first two are purely topological metrics. The blackout size calculation results from a model of cascading failure in power networks. Testing the response of 40 areas within the Eastern US power grid and a standard IEEE test case to a variety of attack/failure vectors indicates that directed attacks result in larger failures using all three vulnerability measures, but the attack vectors that appear to cause the most damage depend on the measure chosen. While our topological and power grid model results show some trends that are similar, there is only a mild correlation between the vulnerability measures for individual simulations. We conclude that evaluating vulnerability in power networks using purely topological metrics can be misleading.},

The DC power flow-based model has been a popular model to study the cascading failure problem due to its efficiency, simplicity and scalability in simulations of such failures. However, due to the complex nature of the power system and cascading failures, the underlying assumptions in DC power flow-based cascading failure simulators (CFS) may fail to hold during the development of cascading failures. This paper compares the validity of a typical DC power flow-based CFS in cascading failure analysis with a new numerical metric defined as the critical moment (CM). The adopted CFS is first implemented to simulate system behavior after initial contingencies and to evaluate the utility of DC-CFS in cascading failure analysis. Then the DC-CFS is compared against another classic, more precise power system stability methodology, i.e., the transient stability analysis (TSA). The CM is introduced with a case study to assess the utilization of these two models for cascading failure analysis. Comparative simulations on the IEEE 39-bus and 68-bus benchmark reveal important consistency and discrepancy between these two approaches. Some suggestions are provided for using these two models in the power grid cascading failure analysis.},

Particularly, we discover that attack strategies that select target nodes (TNs) based on load and degree do not yield the strongest attacks. Instead, we propose a novel metric, called the risk graph, and develop novel attack strategies that are much stronger than the load-based and degree-based attack strategies.

  abstract = {Cascading failures are one of the main reasons for large scale blackouts in power transmission grids. Secure electrical power supply requires, together with careful operation, a robust design of the electrical power grid topology. Currently, the impact of the topology on grid robustness is mainly assessed by purely topological approaches, that fail to capture the essence of electric power flow. This paper proposes a metric, the effective graph resistance, to relate the topology of a power grid to its robustness against cascading failures by deliberate attacks, while also taking the fundamental characteristics of the electric power grid into account such as power flow allocation according to Kirchhoff laws. Experimental verification on synthetic power systems shows that the proposed metric reflects the grid robustness accurately. The proposed metric is used to optimize a grid topology for a higher level of robustness. To demonstrate its applicability, the metric is applied on the IEEE 118 bus power system to improve its robustness against cascading failures. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {This paper reviews the most relevant works that have investigated robustness in power grids using Complex Networks (CN) concepts. In this broad field there are two different approaches. The first one is based solely on topological concepts, and uses metrics such as mean path length, clustering coefficient, efficiency and betweenness centrality, among many others. The second, hybrid approach consists of introducing (into the CN framework) some concepts from Electrical Engineering (EE) in the effort of enhancing the topological approach, and uses novel, more efficient electrical metrics such as electrical betweenness, net-ability, and others. There is however a controversy about whether these approaches are able to provide insights into all aspects of real power grids. The CN community argues that the topological approach does not aim to focus on the detailed operation, but to discover the unexpected emergence of collective behavior, while part of the EE community asserts that this leads to an excessive simplification. Beyond this open debate it seems to be no predominant structure (scale-free, small-world) in high-voltage transmission power grids, the vast majority of power grids studied so far. Most of them have in common that they are vulnerable to targeted attacks on the most connected nodes and robust to random failure. In this respect there are only a few works that propose strategies to improve robustness such as intentional islanding, restricted link addition, microgrids and Energies 2015, 8 9212 smart grids, for which novel studies suggest that small-world networks seem to be the best topology.},

  abstract = {We present an analysis of the topological structure and static tolerance to errors and attacks of the September 2003 actualization of the Union for the Coordination of Transport of Electricity (UCTE) power grid, involving thirty-three different networks. Though every power grid studied has exponential degree distribution and most of them lack typical small-world topology, they display patterns of reaction to node loss similar to those observed in scale-free networks. We have found that the node removal behavior can be logarithmically related to the power grid size. This logarithmic behavior would suggest that, though size favors fragility, growth can reduce it. We conclude that, with the ever-growing demand for power and reliability, actual planning strategies to increase transmission systems would have to take into account this relative increase in vulnerability with size, in order to facilitate and improve the power grid design and functioning.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we analyze the impacts of major electrical properties, including node constraints, line limits, and flow direction, on vulnerability assessment of power grid using several types of electrical betweenness measures. Specifically, we first propose a set of new electrical betweenness measures, which takes into account flow direction in power grids. Then, the impacts of major electrical properties on vulnerability assessment of power grid are analyzed by comparing the identification results of critical components based on the proposed electrical betweenness measures with those based on the other two types of electrical betweenness measures reported in the literature, which take into consideration node constraints and line limits, respectively. Analysis results show the important impact of flow direction on the identification of critical components. The results lead us to introduce a set of combined electrical betweenness measures that take into account node constraints, line limits, and flow direction together. Simulation results on the IEEE 300-bus system and the Italian power grid show that the combined electrical betweenness measures are superior in identifying critical components and more useful in assessing power grid vulnerability.},

  abstract = {A B S T R A C T Power transmission grids play a crucial role as a critical infrastructure by assuring the proper functioning of power systems. In particular, they secure the loads supplied by power generation plants and help avoid blackouts that can have a disastrous impact on society. The power grid structure (number of nodes and lines, their connections, and their physical properties and operational constraints) is one of the key issues (along with generation availability) to assure power system security; consequently, it deserves special attention. A promising approach for the structural analysis of transmission grids with respect to their vulnerabilities is to use metrics and approaches derived from complex network (CN) theory that are shared with other infrastructures such as the World-Wide Web, telecommunication networks, and oil and gas pipelines. These approaches, based on metrics such as global efficiency, degree and betweenness, are purely topological because they study structural vulnerabilities based on the graphical representation of a network as a set of vertices connected by a set of edges. Unfortunately, these approaches fail to capture the physical properties and operational constraints of power systems and, therefore, cannot provide meaningful analyses. This paper proposes an extended topological approach that includes the definitions of traditional topological metrics (e.g., degrees of nodes and global efficiency) as well as the physical/operational behavior of power grids in terms of real power-flow allocation over lines and line flow limits. This approach provides two new metrics, entropic degree and net-ability, that can be used to assess structural vulnerabilities in power systems. The new metrics are applied to test systems as well as real power grids to demonstrate their performance and to contrast them with traditional, purely topological metrics.},

  abstract = {In a network, a local disturbance can propagate and eventually cause a substantial part of the system to fail in cascade events that are easy to conceptualize but extraordinarily difficult to predict. Here, we develop a statistical framework that can predict cascade size distributions by incorporating two ingredients only: the vulnerability of individual components and the cosusceptibility of groups of components (i.e., their tendency to fail together). Using cascades in power grids as a representative example, we show that correlations between component failures define structured and often surprisingly large groups of cosusceptible components. Aside from their implications for blackout studies, these results provide insights and a new modeling framework for understanding cascades in financial systems, food webs, and complex networks in general.},

@Article{Motter,
  abstract = {We live in a modern world supported by large, complex networks. Examples range from financial markets to communication and transportation systems. In many realistic situations the flow of physical quantities in the network, as characterized by the loads on nodes, is important. We show that for such networks where loads can redistribute among the nodes, intentional attacks can lead to a cascade of overload failures, which can in turn cause the entire or a substantial part of the network to collapse. This is relevant for real-world networks that possess a highly heterogeneous distribution of loads, such as the Internet and power grids. We demonstrate that the heterogeneity of these networks makes them particularly vulnerable to attacks in that a large-scale cascade may be triggered by disabling a single key node. This brings obvious concerns on the security of such systems. Complex networks are an essential part of a modern so-ciety ͓1,2͔. It has been shown that many networks, such as the World Wide Web ͑WWW͒, the Internet, and electrical power grids, present a surprisingly small average distance between nodes and a highly organized distribution of links per node ͓3–5͔. Generally, the average distance will not be affected by the removal of a random subset of nodes, but it will increase significantly if the removed nodes are among the most connected ones ͓3͔ ͑see also Refs. ͓6–8͔͒. The ex-istence of a giant connected component in the network, how-ever, does not depend on the presence of highly connected nodes. For instance, the WWW has homepages with many thousands of hyperlinks and can remain well connected after the removal of all homepages with five or more hyperlinks ͓9͔. In addition, the giant component itself is typically a small-world network ͓10͔ even after the removal of all highly connected nodes ͓11͔. These pioneering studies on network security address mainly static properties, i.e., the effect of different network architectures. They suggest that the net-work connectivity, and hence its functionability, is robust against random failure of nodes ͓3,6,7͔ and to some extent is even robust against intentional attacks ͓9,11͔. Here we show that for many physical networks, the removal of nodes can have a much more devastating consequence when the intrin-sic dynamics of flows of physical quantities in the network is taken into account. In a power transmission grid, for in-stance, each node ͑power station͒ deals with a load of power. The removal of nodes, either by random breakdown or inten-tional attacks, changes the balance of flows and leads to a global redistribution of loads over all the network. This can trigger a cascade of overload failures ͓12,13͔, as the one that happened on August 10, 1996 in the western United States power grid ͓14,15͔. Another example is the Internet ͓16 –18͔, where the load represents the amount of information a node ͑router͒ is requested to transmit per unit of time, and over-loads correspond to congestion ͓19͔. Internet collapses caused by congestion have been reported since its very be-ginning ͓20͔. In this Rapid Communication, we introduce a model for cascading failure in complex networks and show that it is applicable to realistic networks such as the Internet and power grids. For a given network, suppose that at each time step one unit of the relevant quantity, which can be information, en-ergy, etc., is exchanged between every pair of nodes and transmitted along the shortest path connecting them. The load at a node is then the total number of shortest paths passing through the node ͓21–23͔. The capacity of a node is the maximum load that the node can handle. In man-made networks, the capacity is severely limited by cost. Thus, it is natural to assume that the capacity C j of node j is propor-tional to its initial load L j ,},
