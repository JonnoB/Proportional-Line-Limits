@article{Gutman1979,
abstract = {This paper contains the development of an analytical basis for the St. Clair line loadability curve and presents the extension of its use into the EHV and UHV transmission area. A brief historical background describes the origin and pertinent aspects of the St. Clair curve including the fact that the old curve, originally intended for transmission voltages up to 330-kV, is derived empirically based upon practical considerations and experience. In order to extend the usefulness of such line loadability characteristics into the EHV and UHV range, a simplified representation of the system, which incorporates flexibility to include both line and system parameters, is utilized to compute maximum line loadability subject to assumed system performance criteria. It is shown that, for a reasonable and consistent set of assumptions, with regard to system parameters and performance criteria, EHV and UHV transmission line loadability characteristics are nearly identical to the original St. Clair curve. The paper further illustrates the relative influence of these assumptions on the derived characteristics, In particular, the electrical strength of the sending- and receiving-end systems is found to have an increasingly important influence on the loadability of transmission lines as the voltage class increases. The analytical approach to determination of transmission line loadability curves enables the user to examine specific situations and assumptions and to avoid possible misinterpretation of generalized conceptual guides-particularly in the EHV/UHV range where system parameters can have a significant impact on loadability.},

@article{Breiman2001,
abstract = {Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund {\{}{\&}{\}} R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148--156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

@book{Marshall1890,
abstract = {Photovoltaic (PV) systems are the most promising renewable energy source in Malaysia due to its abundant solar irradiation. The Malaysian government has launched various renewable energy programs to encourage the use of PV systems. Most of the PV systems are single-phase and the installation is customer driven. Therefore, the growth of PV system in low voltage (LV) distribution network has the potential to raise several technical issues including voltage rise and voltage unbalance. Furthermore, Malaysia is a warm country and geographically surrounded by the sea. The vaporization of the sea water together with the seasonal winds results in a large amount of passing clouds, making this country to be, possibly, the cloudiest region in the world. The solar irradiation is therefore highly scattered and fluctuating. The power output from PV is highly intermittent, hence producing an enormous amount of voltage fluctuations and flickers on the LV distribution networks. All these voltage issues have to be studied experimentally and addressed thoroughly at the early stage before the amount of PV on the network becomes substantial. Therefore, a 7.2 kW grid connected PV system on a radial LV distribution network has been set up to study the voltage issues at the point of common coupling. The power outputs of the PV system are characterised and compared with that of other countries. The probability density of voltage rise and voltage unbalanced factors are derived from the measurement data. Short-term and long-term voltage flicker indexes are calculated to evaluate the severity of the flicker emission. These results are valuable to the policy makers, electricity regulatory body, utility company, customers and PV manufacturers because they can change the policy on the renewable energy and the regulatory framework.

abstract = {The stability and reliability of electrical power grids are indispensable to the continuous operation of modern cities and critical for preparedness, response, recovery and mitigation in emergence management. Because present power grids in China are often running near their critical operation points, they are especially vulnerable and sensitive to external disturbances such as hurricanes, earthquakes and terrorist attacks, which may trigger cascading failures or blackouts. This paper describes a quantitative investigation of the stability and reliability of power grids with a focus on cascading failures under external disturbances. The 118-bus (substation) power network in Hainan, China is employed as a case study to investigate the risk of cascading failure of the regional power grids. System performance and reliability of the power grids are evaluated under two hypothetical scenarios (seismic impact and intentional disturbance) that could trigger cascading failures. By identifying the most vulnerable (critical) edges and nodes, the robustness of the power network is evaluated under the triggered cascading failures. It is found that the system reliabilities could decline as much as 95{\%} during the triggered cascading failure. This paper also explores the use of concepts from modern complex network theories such as state transition graph and characteristic length to understand the complex mechanism of cascading failures. The findings could be useful for power industries and emergency managers to evaluate the vulnerability of power systems, understand the risk of blackout induced by cascading failures, and improve the resilience of power systems to external disturbances. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

We find that the frequency of large blackouts in the United States has not decreased over time, that there is a statistically significant increase in blackout frequency during peak hours of the day and during late summer and mid-winter months (although non-storm-related risk is nearly constant through the year) and that there is strong statistical support for the previously observed power-law statistical relationship between blackout size and frequency. We do not find that blackout sizes and blackout durations are significantly correlated. These trends hold even after controlling for increasing demand and population and after eliminating small events, for which the data may be skewed by spotty reporting. Trends in blackout occurrences, such as those observed in the North American data, have important implications for those who make investment and policy decisions in the electricity industry. We provide a number of examples that illustrate how these trends can inform benefit-cost analysis calculations. Also, following procedures used in natural disaster planning we use the observed statistical trends to calculate the size of the 100-year blackout, which for North America is 186,000 MW. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This paper focuses on line failures in the transmission system of power grids. Recent large-scale power outages demonstrated the limitations of percolation- and epidemic-based tools in modeling failures and cascades in power grids. Hence, we study failures and cascades by using computational tools and a linearized power flow model. We first obtain results regarding the Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse of the power grid admittance matrix. Based on these results, we analytically study the impact of a single line failure on the flows on other lines and introduce metrics to evaluate the robustness of grids to failures. We also illustrate via simulation the impact of the distance and resistance distance on the flow increase following a failure, and discuss the difference from the epidemic models. We use the pseudoinverse of admittance matrix to develop an efficient algorithm to identify the cascading failure evolution, which can be a building block for cascade mitigation. Finally, we show that finding the lines whose removal results in the minimum yield (the fraction of demand satisfied after the cascade) is NP-Hard and present a simple heuristic for finding such a set . Overall, the results demonstrate that using the resistance distance and the pseudoinverse of admittance matrix provides important insights and can support the development of algorithms for designing robust power grids and controlling the evolution of a cascade upon failures.},

In this chapter, we review the literature on the causes and effects of this type of regulation. We begin with a discussion of how researchers measure regulation empirically, which highlights the variety of methods that are used to constrain development. Many theories have been developed to explain why regulation arises, including the role of homeowners in the local political process, the influence of historical density, and the fiscal and exclusionary motives for zoning. As for the effects of regulation, most studies have found substantial effects on the housing market. In particular, regulation appears to raise house prices, reduce construction, reduce the elasticity of housing supply, and alter urban form. Other research has found that regulation influences local labor markets and household sorting across communities. Finally, we discuss the welfare implications of regulation. Although some specific rules clearly mitigate negative externalities, the benefits of more general forms of regulation are very difficult to quantify. On balance, a few recent studies suggest that the overall efficiency losses from binding constraints on residential development could be quite large.},

abstract = {SUMMARY Active energy consumers, often called 'prosumers' because they both consume and produce electricity, could dramatically change the electricity system. Various types of prosumers exist: residential prosumers who produce electricity at home – mainly through solar photovoltaic panels on their rooftops, citizen-led energy cooperatives or housing associations, commercial prosumers whose main business activity is not electricity production, and public institutions like schools or hospitals. The rise in the number of prosumers has been facilitated by the fall in the cost of renewable energy technologies, especially solar panels, which in some Member States produce electricity at a cost that is the same or lower than retail prices. Profitability depends partly on the share of the electricity produced that prosumers can consume themselves. But while this can reduce their bills, it can create problems for traditional energy generators and grid operators. The EU has no specific legislation on prosumers, self-generation or self-consumption, nor a common definition of prosumers. But the Energy Efficiency Directive, the Renewable Energy Directive and Guidelines on State Aid include provisions which relate to small-scale electricity producers. The European Parliament has called for a common operational EU definition of prosumers and for new energy legislation to provide measures for encouraging investment into self-generation capacity.},

abstract = {We give a comprehensive account of a complex systems ap-proach to large blackouts caused by cascading failure. In-stead of looking at the details of particular blackouts, we study the statistics, dynamics and risk of series of blackouts with approximate global models. North American blackout data suggests that the frequency of large blackouts is gov-erned by a power law. This result is consistent with the power system being a complex system designed and oper-ated near criticality. The power law makes the risk of large blackouts consequential and implies the need for nonstan-dard risk analysis. Power system overall load relative to operating limits is a key factor affecting the risk of cascading failure. Blackout models and an abstract model of cascading failure show that there are critical transitions as load is increased. Power law behavior can be observed at these transitions. The critical loads at which blackout risk sharply increases are identifiable thresholds for cascading failure and we dis-cuss approaches to computing the proximity to cascading failure using these thresholds. Approximating cascading failure as a branching process suggests ways to compute and monitor criticality by quantifying how much failures propagate. Inspired by concepts from self-organized criticality, we sug-gest that power system operating margins evolve slowly to near criticality and confirm this idea using a blackout model. Mitigation of blackout risk should take care to ac-count for counter-intuitive effects in complex self-organized critical systems. For example, suppressing small blackouts could lead the system to be operated closer to the edge and ultimately increase the risk of large blackouts.},

abstract = {This paper advocates a theorized approach to second home ownership, which previously has been largely ignored in housing studies or seen as a localized problem. The growth of housing wealth and extended spatial mobility in rich countries has generated explosive growth in the ownership of second (and more) homes with an increasingly transnational dimension. This raises concerns about the concept of the home as a special kind of place. The notion of ‘‘second'' home is considered increasingly problematic owing partly to inherent definitional problems and partly to the growing ownership of multiple dwellings for leisure and leisure-related investment purposes. The growth of second home ownership is conceptualized as a form of gentrification and international comparisons highlight distinctive differences between countries and over time. Household investment and consumption strategies, fuelled by greater mobility and hyper- consumption capacities in rich countries, are seen to be at the core of this rapidly evolving phenomenon.},

Transportation and mobility networks, Internet, mobile phone networks, power grids, social and contact networks, and neural networks, are all examples where space is relevant and where topology alone does not contain all the information. Characterizing and understanding the structure and the evolution of spatial networks is thus crucial for many different fields, ranging from urbanism to epidemiology. An important consequence of space on networks is that there is a cost associated with the length of edges which in turn has dramatic effects on the topological structure of these networks. We will thoroughly explain the current state of our understanding of how the spatial constraints affect the structure and properties of these networks. We will review the most recent empirical observations and the most important models of spatial networks. We will also discuss various processes which take place on these spatial networks, such as phase transitions, random walks, synchronization, navigation, resilience, and disease spread.},

abstract = {The North American power grid is one of the most complex technological networks, and its interconnectivity allows both for long-distance power transmission and for the propagation of disturbances. We model the power grid using its actual topology and plausible assumptions about the load and overload of transmission substations. Our results indicate that the loss of a single substation can result in up to 25{\%} loss of transmission efficiency by triggering an overload cascade in the network. The actual transmission loss depends on the overload tolerance of the network and the connectivity of the failed substation. We systematically study the damage inflicted by the loss of single nodes, and find three universal behaviors, suggesting that 40{\%} of the transmission substations lead to cascading failures when disrupted. While the loss of a single node can inflict substantial damage, subsequent removals have only incremental effects, in agreement with the topological resilience to less than 1{\%} node loss.

abstract = {A large-scale power grid's ability to transfer energy from producers to consumers is constrained by both the network structure and the nonlinear physics of power flow. Violations of these constraints have been observed to result in voltage collapse blackouts, where nodal voltages slowly decline before precipitously falling. However, methods to test for voltage collapse are dominantly simulation-based, offering little theoretical insight into how grid structure influences stability margins. For a simplified power flow model, here we derive a closed-form condition under which a power network is safe from voltage collapse. The condition combines the complex structure of the network with the reactive power demands of loads to produce a node-by-node measure of grid stress, a prediction of the largest nodal voltage deviation, and an estimate of the distance to collapse. We extensively test our predictions on large-scale systems, highlighting how our condition can be leveraged to increase grid stability margins.},

abstract = {—This paper presents a general graph representation learning framework called DeepGL for learning deep node and edge representations from large (attributed) graphs. In particular, DeepGL begins by deriving a set of base features (e.g., graphlet features) and automatically learns a multi-layered hierarchical graph representation where each successive layer leverages the output from the previous layer to learn features of a higher-order. Contrary to previous work, DeepGL learns relational functions (each representing a feature) that generalize across-networks and therefore useful for graph-based transfer learning tasks. Moreover, DeepGL naturally supports attributed graphs, learns interpretable graph representations, and is space-efficient (by learning sparse feature vectors). In addition, DeepGL is expressive, flexible with many interchangeable components, efficient with a time complexity of O(|E|), and scalable for large networks via an efficient parallel implementation. Compared with the state-of-the-art method, DeepGL is (1) effective for across-network transfer learning tasks and attributed graph representation learning, (2) space-efficient requiring up to 6× less memory, (3) fast with up to 182× speedup in runtime performance, and (4) accurate with an average improvement of 20{\%} or more on many learning tasks.},

However, the results of even the best energy system model will highly depend on the underlying input data. First, in this contribution the importance and availability issues of grid data in the context of energy system modelling are highlighted. Second, this paper focuses on power grid modelling based on open and publicly available data from OpenStreetMap using open source software tools. Two recent approaches developed to build electrical transmission network models using openly available data sources are presented and discussed. The proposed methods provide transparent assumptions, simplifications and documentation of grid modelling. This results in the ability of scientists and other stakeholders to validate, discuss or reproduce the results of energy system models. Thus the new open approaches offer a unique opportunity to increase transparency, comparability and reproducibility of results in energy system modelling.},

Here, the tolerance of electric power grids to both accidental and malicious outages is analyzed in the framework of complex network theory. In particular, the quantity known as efficiency is modified by introducing a new concept of distance between nodes. As a result, a new parameter called net-ability is proposed to evaluate the performance of power grids. A comparison between efficiency and net-ability is provided by estimating the vulnerability of sample networks, in terms of both the metrics.},

To be able to estimate the cancer risk of the patients and to assess the impact of interventional therapies thereon, it is of particular interest to measure the patients' burden of genomic damage. Chromosomal abnormalities, reduced DNA repair, and DNA lesions were found indeed in cells of patients with CKD. Biomarkers for DNA damage measurable in easily accessible cells like peripheral blood lymphocytes are chromosomal aberrations, structural DNA lesions, and oxidatively modified DNA bases. In this review the most common methods quantifying the three parameters mentioned above, the cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay, the comet assay, and the quantification of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2′-deoxyguanosine, are evaluated concerning the feasibility of the analysis and regarding the marker's potential to predict clinical outcomes.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Smart grid research has tended to be compartmentalised, with notable contributions from economics, electrical engineering and science and technology studies. However, there is an acknowledged and growing need for an integrated systems approach to the evaluation of smart grid initiatives. The capacity to simulate and explore smart grid possibilities on various scales is key to such an integrated approach but existing models – even if multidisciplinary – tend to have a limited focus. This paper describes an innovative and flexible framework that has been developed to facilitate the simulation of various smart grid scenarios and the interconnected social, technical and economic networks from a complex systems perspective. The architecture is described and related to realised examples of its use, both to model the electricity system as it is today and to model futures that have been envisioned in the literature. Potential future applications of the framework are explored, along with its utility as an analytic and decision support tool for smart grid stakeholders.},

abstract = {Foreign investment in residential real estate-especially by new middle-class and super-rich investors-is re-emerging as a key political issue in academic, policy and public debates. On the one hand, global real estate has become an asset class for foreign individual and institutional investors seeking to diversify their investment portfolios. On the other, a suite of intergenerational migration and education plans may also be motivating foreign investors. Government and public responses to the latest manifestation of global real estate investment have taken different forms. These range from pro-foreign investment, primarily justified on geopolitical economic grounds, to anti-foreign investment for reasons such as mitigating public dissent and protecting the local housing market. Within this changing global context, the six articles in this special issue on the globalisation of real estate present a diverse range of empirical case studies from Canada, Hong Kong, Singapore, Russia, Australia and Korea. This editorial highlights four methodological challenges that the articles collectively highlight; they are (1) investor cohorts and property types, (2) regulatory settings, (3) geopolitics and (4) spatial differences and temporal trajectories. {\textcopyright} 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor {\&} Francis Group.},

Inspired by the various non-linearity of electric load data and the strong learning capacity of support vector regression (SVR) for small sample and balanced data, this paper presents an adaptive fuzzy combination model based on the self-organizing map (SOM), the SVR and the fuzzy inference method. The adaptive fuzzy combination model can effectively count for electric load forecasting with good accuracy and interpretability at the same time. The key idea behind the combination is to build a human-understandable knowledge base by constructing a fuzzy membership function for each homogeneous sub-population. The comparison of different mathematical models and the effectiveness of the presented model are shown by the real data of New South Wales electricity market. The obtained results confirm the validity of the developed model.},

Photovoltaic cells are the most disruptive energy technology as they allow consumers of all sizes to produce power by themselves—new actors in the power market can begin operating with a new bottom-up control logic. Unsubsidised PV markets may start to take off in 2013, fuelling substantial growth where PV power is getting cheaper than grid or diesel backup electricity for commercial consumers. Managing loads and achieving a good match between power consumption and weather-dependent power production will likely become a key issue. This consumption—production balance may trigger massive innovation and investment in energy management technologies involving different kinds of storage and controls. Increasing autonomy and flexibility of consumers challenges the top-down control logic of traditional power supply and pushes for a more decentralised and multi-layered system. How rapidly and smoothly this transformation occurs depends to a large extent on the adaptation speed of the regulatory framework and on the ability of market players to develop appropriate business models.

abstract = {Security issues related to power grid networks have attracted the attention of researchers in many fields. Recently, a new network model that combines complex network theories with power flow models was proposed. This model, referred to as the extended model, is suitable for investigating vulnerabilities in power grid networks. In this paper, we study cascading failures of power grids under the extended model. Particularly, we discover that attack strategies that select target nodes (TNs) based on load and degree do not yield the strongest attacks. Instead, we propose a novel metric, called the risk graph, and develop novel attack strategies that are much stronger than the load-based and degree-based attack strategies. The proposed approaches and the comparison approaches are tested on IEEE 57 and 118 bus systems and Polish transmission system. The results demonstrate that the proposed approaches can reveal the power grid vulnerability in terms of causing cascading failures more effectively than the comparison approaches.},

Recently, new deep learning ap-proaches have emerged for representing and modeling graph-structured data while the conventional deep learning methods, such as convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks, have mainly focused on the grid-structured inputs of image and audio. Leveraged by representation learning ca-pabilities, deep learning-based techniques can detect struc-tural characteristics of graphs, giving promising results for graph applications. In this paper, we attempt to advance deep learning for graph-structured data by incorporating another component: transfer learning. By transferring the intrinsic ge-ometric information learned in the source domain, our ap-proach can construct a model for a new but related task in the target domain without collecting new data and without training a new model from scratch. We thoroughly tested our approach with large-scale real-world text data and confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed transfer learning framework for deep learning on graphs. According to our experiments, transfer learning is most effective when the source and tar-get domains bear a high level of structural similarity in their graph representations.},

Besides ur- ban growth, as this article argues, effects of industrialization have likewise intensified urban shrinkage. Cities of the industrial age have experienced unprecedented economic crises followed by waves of out-migration; they have suffered from violent destruction, made possible by the mechanization of war; they have been drained by suburbanization driven by an industrial- ized building sector and increasing private car ownership; and they have un- dergone processes of deindustrialization followed by losses of workplaces and population. This article outlines the historic development of urban shrinkage in the twentieth century, with a particular focus on the aged in- dustrial countries.

Furthermore, for semi-Riemannian manifolds of arbitrary signature we prove that the conformal holonomy algebra of a C-space is a Berger algebra. For Ricci-flat spaces we show how the conformal holonomy can be obtained by the holonomy of the ambient metric and get results for Riemannian manifolds and plane waves.},

abstract = {Deep Learning's recent successes have mostly relied on Convolutional Networks, which exploit fundamental statistical properties of images, sounds and video data: the local stationarity and multi-scale compositional structure, that allows expressing long range interactions in terms of shorter, localized interactions. However, there exist other important examples, such as text documents or bioinformatic data, that may lack some or all of these strong statistical regularities. In this paper we consider the general question of how to construct deep architectures with small learning complexity on general non-Euclidean domains, which are typically unknown and need to be estimated from the data. In particular, we develop an extension of Spectral Networks which incorporates a Graph Estimation procedure, that we test on large-scale classification problems, matching or improving over Dropout Networks with far less parameters to estimate.},

The ability to assess the impact of these changes, e.g., the integration of more solar power or electric mobility, requires data and tools that only exist partially today. The goal of this paper is to introduce OpenGridMap, a new project with the goal of creating an open platform for inferring realistic power grids based on actual data. Our vision is to provide a tool to researchers and practitioners that is able to produce realistic input data for simulation studies. OpenGridMap will support the entire process from data collection to formatting grid data for various purposes. We explore innovative ways to capture data and produce power grid approximations, e.g., using smartphone apps, expert classification, existing map APIs, and graph inference algorithms.

abstract = {The Complex Adaptive Systems, Cognitive Agents and Distributed Energy (CASCADE) project is developing a framework based on Agent Based Modelling (ABM). The CASCADE Framework can be used both to gain policy and industry relevant insights into the smart grid concept itself and as a platform to design and test distributed ICT solutions for smart grid based business entities. ABM is used to capture the behaviors of different social, economic and technical actors, which may be defined at various levels of abstraction. It is applied to understanding their interactions and can be adapted to include learning processes and emergent patterns. CASCADE models 'prosumer' agents (i.e., producers and/or consumers of energy) and 'aggregator' agents (e.g., traders of energy in both wholesale and retail markets) at various scales, from large generators and Energy Service Companies down to individual people and devices. The CASCADE Framework is formed of three main subdivisions that link models of electricity supply and demand, the electricity market and power flow. It can also model the variability of renewable energy generation caused by the weather, which is an important issue for grid balancing and the profitability of energy suppliers. The development of CASCADE has already yielded some interesting early findings, demonstrating that it is possible for a mediating agent (aggregator) to achieve stable demand-flattening across groups of domestic households fitted with smart energy control and communication devices, where direct wholesale price signals had previously been found to produce characteristic complex system instability. In another example, it has demonstrated how large changes in supply mix can be caused even by small changes in demand profile. Ongoing and planned refinements to the Framework will support investigation of demand response at various scales, the integration of the power sector with transport and heat sectors, novel technology adoption and diffusion work, evolution of new smart grid business models, and complex power grid engineering and market interactions.

abstract = {NATURE | VOL 406 | 27 JULY 2000 | www.nature.com 379 called scale-free networks, which include the World-Wide Web 3–5 , the Internet 6 , social networks 7 and cells 8 . We find that such networks display an unexpected degree of robustness, the ability of their nodes to communicate being unaffected even by un-realistically high failure rates. However, error tolerance comes at a high price in that these networks are extremely vulnerable to attacks (that is, to the selection and removal of a few nodes that play a vital role in maintaining the network's connectivity). Such error tolerance and attack vulnerability are generic properties of communication networks. The increasing availability of topological data on large networks, aided by the computerization of data acquisition, had led to great advances in our understanding of the generic aspects of network structure and development 9–16 . The existing empirical and theo-retical results indicate that complex networks can be divided into two major classes based on their connectivity distribution P(k), giving the probability that a node in the network is connected to k other nodes. The first class of networks is characterized by a P(k) that peaks at an average k and decays exponentially for large k. The most investigated examples of such exponential networks are the random graph model of Erd{\"{o}}s and R{\'{e}}nyi 9,10 and the small-world model of Watts and Strogatz 11},

abstract = {Previous research has shown that housing abandonment contributes to neighborhood decline by depressing nearby property values. However, most past research estimated the impact of abandonment through cross-sectional analysis without controlling for nearby foreclosures or local housing market trends. Therefore, it remains unclear whether abandoned properties reduce nearby property values or whether abandonment is more common in areas with already lower-valued properties. Prior research also has not explored how the duration of abandonment influences nearby property values. Therefore, to extend the current level of understanding of the impact of abandonment, this research examines the impact of abandoned properties on nearby property values in Baltimore, Maryland, from 1991 to 2010 using longitudinal data sets while simultaneously controlling for both nearby foreclosures and local housing market trends. This research finds that as properties are abandoned for longer periods of time, the impact on nearby property values not only increases in magnitude but also is seen increasingly farther away.

abstract = {Populations in resource dependent economies gain well-being from the natural environment, in highly spatially and temporally variable patterns. To collect information on this, we designed and implemented a 1586-household quantitative survey in the southwest coastal zone of Bangladesh. Data were collected on material, subjective and health dimensions of well-being in the context of natural resource use, particularly agriculture, aquaculture, mangroves and fisheries. The questionnaire included questions on factors that mediate poverty outcomes: mobility and remittances; loans and micro-credit; environmental perceptions; shocks; and women's empowerment. The data are stratified by social-ecological system to take into account spatial dynamics and the survey was repeated with the same respondents three times within a year to incorporate seasonal dynamics. The dataset includes blood pressure measurements and height and weight of men, women and children. In addition, the household listing includes basic data on livelihoods and income for approximately 10,000 households. The dataset facilitates interdisciplinary research on spatial and temporal dynamics of well-being in the context of natural resource dependence in low income countries.},

abstract = {The shift towards an energy Grid dominated by prosumers (consumers and producers of energy) will inevitably have repercussions on the distribution infrastructure. Today it is a hierarchical one designed to deliver energy from large scale facilities to end-users. Tomorrow it will be a capillary infrastructure at the medium and Low Voltage levels that will support local energy trading among prosumers. In our previous work, we analyzed the Dutch Power Grid and made an initial analysis of the economic impact topological properties have on decentralized energy trading. In this paper, we go one step further and investigate how different networks topologies and growth models facilitate the emergence of a decentralized market. In particular, we show how the connectivity plays an important role in improving the properties of reliability and path-cost reduction. From the economic point of view, we estimate how the topological evolutions facilitate local electricity distribution, taking into account the main cost ingredient required for increasing network connectivity, i.e., the price of cabling.},

abstract = {Although the volatility of house prices is often ascribed to demand-side factors, constraints on housing supply have important and little-studied implications for housing dynamics. I illustrate the strong relationship between the volatility of house prices and the regulation of new housing supply. I then employ a dynamic structural model of housing investment to investigate the mechanisms underlying this relationship. I find that supply constraints increase volatility through two channels: First, regulation lowers the elasticity of new housing supply by increasing lags in the permit process and adding to the cost of supplying new houses on the margin. Second, geographic limitations on the area available for building houses, such as steep slopes and water bodies, lead to less investment on average relative to the size of the existing housing stock, leaving less scope for the supply response to attenuate the effects of a demand shock. My estimates and simulations confirm that regulation and geographic constraints play critical and complementary roles in decreasing the responsiveness of investment to demand shocks, which in turn amplifies house price volatility. {\textcopyright} 2013.},

The report focuses on the " financialization of housing " and its impact on human rights. It examines structural changes that have occurred in recent years whereby massive amounts of global capital have been invested in housing as a commodity, as security for financial instruments that are traded on global markets, and as a means of accumulating wealth. The report assesses the effect of those historic changes on the enjoyment of the right to adequate housing and outlines an appropriate human rights framework for States to address them. The report reviews the role of domestic and international law in that sphere, and considers the application of principles of business and human rights. The report concludes with a review of States' policy responses to the financialization of housing and some recommendations for more coherent and effective strategies to ensure that the actions of global financial institutions and actors are consistent with ensuring access to housing for all by 2030. The Special Rapporteur suggests that, as a way forward, States must redefine their relationship with private investors and international financial institutions, and reform the governance of financial markets so that, rather than treating housing as a commodity valued primarily as an asset for the accumulation of wealth they reclaim housing as a social good, and thus ensure the human right to a place to live in security and dignity.},

It is a computer-compatible coding system that permits on-line data reduction of interactional variables emphasizing contextual and structural dimensions of family behavior. To date, the HOAM has been applied to the study of 31 families observed for a total of over 250 sessions. Initial analysis of data from these sessions indicates that coder reliability is high and that the HOAM successfully measures dimensions of family behavior independent of architectural aspects of the home setting. Preliminary findings also indicate that although families differ dramatically along the interactional dimensions measured by the HOAM, all families studied spent remarkably little time in decision-making behavior, suggesting that behavior in the home is predominantly "maintenance-oriented."},

abstract = {When the modern electrical infrastructure is undergoing a migration to the Smart Grid, vulnerability and security concerns have also been raised regarding the cascading failure threats in this interconnected transmission system with complex communication and control challenge. The DC power flow-based model has been a popular model to study the cascading failure problem due to its efficiency, simplicity and scalability in simulations of such failures. However, due to the complex nature of the power system and cascading failures, the underlying assumptions in DC power flow-based cascading failure simulators (CFS) may fail to hold during the development of cascading failures. This paper compares the validity of a typical DC power flow-based CFS in cascading failure analysis with a new numerical metric defined as the critical moment (CM). The adopted CFS is first implemented to simulate system behavior after initial contingencies and to evaluate the utility of DC-CFS in cascading failure analysis. Then the DC-CFS is compared against another classic, more precise power system stability methodology, i.e., the transient stability analysis (TSA). The CM is introduced with a case study to assess the utilization of these two models for cascading failure analysis. Comparative simulations on the IEEE 39-bus and 68-bus benchmark reveal important consistency and discrepancy between these two approaches. Some suggestions are provided for using these two models in the power grid cascading failure analysis.},

abstract = {A B S T R A C T Power transmission grids play a crucial role as a critical infrastructure by assuring the proper functioning of power systems. In particular, they secure the loads supplied by power generation plants and help avoid blackouts that can have a disastrous impact on society. The power grid structure (number of nodes and lines, their connections, and their physical properties and operational constraints) is one of the key issues (along with generation availability) to assure power system security; consequently, it deserves special attention. A promising approach for the structural analysis of transmission grids with respect to their vulnerabilities is to use metrics and approaches derived from complex network (CN) theory that are shared with other infrastructures such as the World-Wide Web, telecommunication networks, and oil and gas pipelines. These approaches, based on metrics such as global efficiency, degree and betweenness, are purely topological because they study structural vulnerabilities based on the graphical representation of a network as a set of vertices connected by a set of edges. Unfortunately, these approaches fail to capture the physical properties and operational constraints of power systems and, therefore, cannot provide meaningful analyses. This paper proposes an extended topological approach that includes the definitions of traditional topological metrics (e.g., degrees of nodes and global efficiency) as well as the physical/operational behavior of power grids in terms of real power-flow allocation over lines and line flow limits. This approach provides two new metrics, entropic degree and net-ability, that can be used to assess structural vulnerabilities in power systems. The new metrics are applied to test systems as well as real power grids to demonstrate their performance and to contrast them with traditional, purely topological metrics.},

abstract = {Many countries are rolling out smart electricity meters. These measure a home's total power demand. However, research into consumer behaviour suggests that consumers are best able to improve their energy efficiency when provided with itemised, appliance-by-appliance consumption information. Energy disaggregation is a computational technique for estimating appliance-by-appliance energy consumption from a whole-house meter signal. To conduct research on disaggregation algorithms, researchers require data describing not just the aggregate demand per building but also the 'ground truth' demand of individual appliances. In this context, we present UK-DALE: an open-access dataset from the UK recording Domestic Appliance-Level Electricity at a sample rate of 16 kHz for the whole-house and at 1/6 Hz for individual appliances. This is the first open access UK dataset at this temporal resolution. We recorded from five houses, one of which was recorded for 655 days, the longest duration we are aware of for any energy dataset at this sample rate. We also describe the low-cost, open-source, wireless system we built for collecting our dataset.},

abstract = {Housing is a key object of financialization. There is a small but growing literature on the financialization of housing that has demonstrated how housing is a central aspect of financialization. Despite the varied analyses of the financialization of housing and the importance of housing to financialization, the relations between housing and financialization remain under- researched and under-theorized. The financialization of housing is not so much a specific from of financialization, as it transcends several of the different forms of financialization. Housing systems, in particular, differ widely across the globe, which implies that housing financialization will be inherently variegated, path-dependent and uneven. In this introduction to the Symposium, I will discuss how the articles in this Symposium contribute to the literature on the financialization of housing. Housing has entered a post-Fordist, neoliberal and financialized regime. Both mortgaged homeownership and subsidized rental housing increasingly are there to keep financial markets going, rather than being facilitated by those markets. There is little evidence that the global financial crisis has resulted in a de-financialization of housing. There are common trajectories within uneven and variegated financialization rather than radically different and completely unrelated forms of housing financialization.},

abstract = {Many complex systems display a surprising degree of tolerance against errors. For example, relatively simple organisms grow, persist and reproduce despite drastic pharmaceutical or environmental interventions, an error tolerance attributed to the robustness of the underlying metabolic network(1). Complex communication networks(2) display a surprising degree of robustness: although key components regularly malfunction, local failures rarely lead to the loss of the global information-carrying ability of the network. The stability of these and other complex systems is often attributed to the redundant wiring of the functional web defined by the systems' components. Here we demonstrate that error tolerance is not shared by all redundant systems: it is displayed only by a class of inhomogeneously wired networks, called scale-free networks, which include the World-Wide Web(3-5), the Internet(6), social networks(7) and cells(8). We find that such networks display an unexpected degree of robustness, the ability of their nodes to communicate being unaffected even by unrealistically high failure rates. However, error tolerance comes at a high price in that these networks are extremely vulnerable to attacks (that is, to the selection and removal of a few nodes that play a vital role in maintaining the network's connectivity). Such error tolerance and attack vulnerability are generic properties of communication networks.},

abstract = {Increased coupling between critical infrastructure networks, such as power and communications, has important implications for the reliability and security of these networks. To understand the implications of power-communications coupling, researchers have studied interdependent network models and reported that increased coupling can increase system vulnerability [1, 2]. However, these results come from models that have substantially different mechanisms of cascading, relative to those found in actual power and communications networks. This paper reports on two sets of experiments that compare the network vulnerability implications resulting from simple topological models and models that more accurately capture the dynamics of cascading in power systems. In the first set of experiments, we compare a simple model of intra-network cascading to a power grid model and find that the power grid model reveals that power grids have a higher level of vulnerability, relative to what would be inferred from a topological contagion model. In a second set of experiments, we compare the coupled topological model from [1] to three different physics-based models of power grids coupled to communication networks. Again, the results show that more accurate models lead to very different conclusions. In all but the most extreme case, the physics-based power grid models suggest that increased power-communications coupling decreases vulnerability. This is opposite from what one would conclude from the model in [1], in which zero coupling is optimal. Finally, an extreme case, in which communications failures immediately cause grid failures, suggests that if systems are poorly designed, increased coupling can be harmful.},

Specifically, we first propose a set of new electrical betweenness measures, which takes into account flow direction in power grids. Then, the impacts of major electrical properties on vulnerability assessment of power grid are analyzed by comparing the identification results of critical components based on the proposed electrical betweenness measures with those based on the other two types of electrical betweenness measures reported in the literature, which take into consideration node constraints and line limits, respectively. Analysis results show the important impact of flow direction on the identification of critical components. The results lead us to introduce a set of combined electrical betweenness measures that take into account node constraints, line limits, and flow direction together. Simulation results on the IEEE 300-bus system and the Italian power grid show that the combined electrical betweenness measures are superior in identifying critical components and more useful in assessing power grid vulnerability.},

Both network analyses and load ranking methods have their own limitations. In this paper, based on self-organizing map (SOM), we propose an integrated approach combining spatial feature (distance)-based clustering with electrical characteristics (load) to assess the vulnerability and cascading effect of multiple component sets in the power grid. Using the clustering result from SOM, we choose sets of heavy-loaded initial victims to perform attack schemes and evaluate the subsequent cascading effect of their failures, and this SOM-based approach effectively identifies the more vulnerable sets of substations than those from the traditional load ranking and other clustering methods. As a result, this new approach provides an efficient and reliable technique to study the power system failure behavior in cascading effect of critical component failure.},

Here, we develop a statistical framework that can predict cascade size distributions by incorporating two ingredients only: the vulnerability of individual components and the cosusceptibility of groups of components (i.e., their tendency to fail together). Using cascades in power grids as a representative example, we show that correlations between component failures define structured and often surprisingly large groups of cosusceptible components. Aside from their implications for blackout studies, these results provide insights and a new modeling framework for understanding cascades in financial systems, food webs, and complex networks in general.},

abstract = {Small initial failures in power grids can lead to large cascading failures, which have significant economic and social costs, and it is imperative to understand the dynamics of these systems and to mitigate risks of such failures. We directly compare two prominent models for cascading failures in power grids: a power flow model-ORNL-PSerc-Alaska (OPA) and a complex networks model-Crucitti-Latora-Marchiori (CLM). Quantitative comparison of these two models is not trivial and has not been previously performed, so we present a method to quantitatively compare the two using transmission capacity as a common variable. Primarily, we find that the two models exhibit similar phase transitions in average network damage (load shed/demand in OPA, path damage in CLM) with respect to transmission capacity, sharing a common critical region and similar transitions in probability distributions of network damage size. Furthermore, we find that both OPA and CLM reveal similar impacts of network topology, size and heterogeneity of transmission capacity, with respect to vulnerability to large cascades. Thus, our analysis indicates that the CLM model, despite neglecting realistic power flow assumptions and exhibiting differences in behaviour at the local scale, nonetheless exhibits ensemble properties which are consistent with the more realistic OPA fast-scale model. Given the advantages of simplicity and scalability of CLM, these results provide impetus for the use of complex networks models to study ensemble properties of cascading failures in larger power grid networks. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This paper reviews the most relevant works that have investigated robustness in power grids using Complex Networks (CN) concepts. In this broad field there are two different approaches. The first one is based solely on topological concepts, and uses metrics such as mean path length, clustering coefficient, efficiency and betweenness centrality, among many others. The second, hybrid approach consists of introducing (into the CN framework) some concepts from Electrical Engineering (EE) in the effort of enhancing the topological approach, and uses novel, more efficient electrical metrics such as electrical betweenness, net-ability, and others. There is however a controversy about whether these approaches are able to provide insights into all aspects of real power grids. The CN community argues that the topological approach does not aim to focus on the detailed operation, but to discover the unexpected emergence of collective behavior, while part of the EE community asserts that this leads to an excessive simplification. Beyond this open debate it seems to be no predominant structure (scale-free, small-world) in high-voltage transmission power grids, the vast majority of power grids studied so far. Most of them have in common that they are vulnerable to targeted attacks on the most connected nodes and robust to random failure. In this respect there are only a few works that propose strategies to improve robustness such as intentional islanding, restricted link addition, microgrids and Energies 2015, 8 9212 smart grids, for which novel studies suggest that small-world networks seem to be the best topology.},

A multiple linear regression model was applied to four parameters: total electricity consumption, maximum demand, load factor and time of use (ToU) of maximum electricity demand for a number of different dwelling and occupant socio-economic variables. In particular, dwelling type, number of bedrooms, head of household (HoH) age, household composition, social class, water heating and cooking type all had a significant influence over total domestic electricity consumption. Maximum electricity demand was significantly influenced by household composition as well as water heating and cooking type. A strong relationship also existed between maximum demand and most household appliances but, in particular, tumble dryers, dishwashers and electric cookers had the greatest influence over this parameter. Time of use (ToU) for maximum electricity demand was found to be strongly influenced by occupant characteristics, HoH age and household composition. Younger head of households were more inclined to use electricity later in the evening than older occupants. The appliance that showed the greatest potential for shifting demand away from peak time use was the dishwasher. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This article examines the experience of operationalising the housing market area (HMA) framework in England and reflects on the value of adopting HMAs in strategic planning of housing. The paper argues that the operationalisation of HMAs in the English regions has been a challenging exercise, but that HMAs have the potential to frame the development of housing market intelligence and to underpin the analysis of housing market functionality at sub-national level. The challenge for policy and practice lies in harnessing this evidence-framing and analytical potential more effectively than has been the case to date.},

abstract = {Electric power transmission systems are a key infrastructure, and blackouts of these systems have major consequences for the economy and national security. Analyses of blackout data suggest that blackout size distributions have a power law form over much of their range. This result is an indication that blackouts behave as a complex dynamical system. We use a simulation of an upgrading power transmission system to investigate how these complex system dynamics impact the assessment and mitigation of blackout risk. The mitigation of failures in complex systems needs to be approached with care. The mitigation efforts can move the system to a new dynamic equilibrium while remaining near criticality and preserving the power law region. Thus, while the absolute frequency of blackouts of all sizes may be reduced, the underlying forces can still cause the relative frequency of large blackouts to small blackouts to remain the same. Moreover, in some cases, efforts to mitigate small blackouts can even increase the frequency of large blackouts. This result occurs because the large and small blackouts are not mutually independent, but are strongly coupled by the complex dynamics.},

abstract = {A model has been developed to study the global complex dynamics of a series of blackouts in power transmission systems [1, 2]. This model has included a simple level of self-organization by incorporating the growth of power demand and the engineering response to system failures. Two types of blackouts have been identified with different dynamical properties. One type of blackout involves loss of load due to lines reaching their load limits but no line outages. The second type of blackout is associated with multiple line outages. The dominance of one type of blackouts versus the other depends on operational conditions and the proximity of the system to one of its two critical points. The first critical point is characterized by operation with lines close to their line limits. The second critical point is characterized by the maximum in the fluctuations of the load demand being near the generator margin capability. The identification of this second critical point is an indication that the increase of the generator capability as a response to the increase of the load demand must be included in the dynamical model to achieve a higher degree of self-organization. When this is done, the model shows a probability distribution of blackout sizes with power tails similar to that observed in real blackout data from North America.},

abstract = {Modeling power transmission networks is an important area of research with applications such as vulnerability analysis, study of cascading failures, and location of measurement devices. Graph-theoretic approaches have been widely used to solve these problems, but are subject to several limitations. One of the limitations is the ability to model a heterogeneous system in a consistent manner using the standard graph-theoretic formulation. In this paper, we propose a network-of-networks approach for modeling power transmission networks in order to explicitly incorporate heterogeneity in the model. This model distinguishes between different components of the network that operate at different voltage ratings, and also captures the intra and inter-network connectivity patterns. By building the graph in this fashion we present a novel, and fundamentally different, perspective of power transmission networks. Consequently, this novel approach will have a significant impact on the graph-theoretic modeling of power grids that we believe will lead to a better understanding of transmission networks.},

abstract = {In this paper, we begin by documenting substantial variation in house price growth across neighborhoods within a city during city-wide housing price booms. We then present a model which links house price movements across neighborhoods within a city and the gentrification of those neighborhoods in response to a city wide housing demand shock. A key ingredient in our model is a positive neighborhood externality: individuals like to live next to richer neighbors. This generates an equilibrium where households segregate based upon their income. In response to a city-wide demand shock, higher income residents will choose to expand their housing by migrating into the poorer neighborhoods that directly abut the initial richer neighborhoods. The in-migration of the richer residents into these border neighborhoods will bid up prices in those neighborhoods causing the original poorer residents to migrate out. We refer to this process as "endogenous gentrification". Using a variety of data sets and using Bartik variation across cities to identify city level housing demand shocks, we find strong empirical support for the model's predictions. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Cascading failures are one of the main reasons for large scale blackouts in power transmission grids. Secure electrical power supply requires, together with careful operation, a robust design of the electrical power grid topology. Currently, the impact of the topology on grid robustness is mainly assessed by purely topological approaches, that fail to capture the essence of electric power flow. This paper proposes a metric, the effective graph resistance, to relate the topology of a power grid to its robustness against cascading failures by deliberate attacks, while also taking the fundamental characteristics of the electric power grid into account such as power flow allocation according to Kirchhoff laws. Experimental verification on synthetic power systems shows that the proposed metric reflects the grid robustness accurately. The proposed metric is used to optimize a grid topology for a higher level of robustness. To demonstrate its applicability, the metric is applied on the IEEE 118 bus power system to improve its robustness against cascading failures. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Gallent2016,
abstract = {Recombinant protein production processes are typically divided into two phases. In the first one, pure cell propagation takes place, while in the second one product formation is switched on within the cells by adding an inducer. In the initial biomass formation phase, the cell density is rather low and, hence, the measurement quantities that could be used to determine the process' state depict small values and are rather severely distorted by measurement noise. Because of these measurement problems, the fermentation cannot be reliably controlled by feedback control during this first production phase; instead, the process must be controlled in an open-loop fashion. The consequence, worked out in this paper, is to design substrate feed rate profiles for the growth phase in such a way that they are robust with respect to the main disturbances observed in practice. The robustness of the biomass formation is shown to be primarily dependent on the specific growth rate adjusted in the first hours. High batch-to-batch reproducibility can be obtained with exponential feeding profiles F(t) corresponding to specific growth rates micro(set) well below the maximal specific growth rate micro(max) of the organism. The reduction in the growth rate needed to obtain a robust process behavior depends on the inaccuracies in the initial biomass concentrations. Quantitative feed rate profiles were obtained by numerical simulation and these results were validated experimentally by means of a series of cultivation runs, where a recombinant pharmaceutical protein was produced. All experimental data confirmed the assumptions made in the robust process design study.},

abstract = {Numerous recent papers have found important relationships between network structure and risks within networks. These results indicate that network structure can dramatically affect the relative effectiveness of risk identification and mitigation methods. With this in mind this paper provides a comparative analysis of the topological and electrical structure of the IEEE 300 bus and the Eastern United States power grids. Specifically we compare the topology of these grids with that of random, preferential-attachment and small-world networks of equivalent sizes and find that power grids differ substantially from these abstract models in degree distribution, clustering, diameter and assortativity, and thus conclude that these abstract models do not provide substantial utility for modeling power grids. To better represent the topological properties of power grids we introduce a new , the minimum distance graph, that produces networks with properties that more nearly match those of known power grids. While these topological comparisons are useful, they do not account for the physical laws that govern flows in electricity networks. To elucidate the electrical structure of power grids, we propose a new method for representing electrical structure as a weighted graph. This analogous representation is based on electrical distance rather than topological connections. A comparison of these two representations of the test power grids reveals dramatic differences between the electrical and topological structure of electrical power systems.},

@article{Watts2002,
abstract = {The origin of large but rare cascades that are triggered by small initial shocks is a phenomenon that manifests itself as diversely as cultural fads, collective action, the diffusion of norms and innovations, and cascading failures in infrastructure and organizational networks. This paper presents a possible explanation of this phenomenon in terms of a sparse, random network of interacting agents whose decisions are determined by the actions of their neighbors according to a simple threshold rule. Two regimes are identified in which the network is susceptible to very large cascades-herein called global cascades-that occur very rarely. When cascade propagation is limited by the connectivity of the network, a power law distribution of cascade sizes is observed, analogous to the cluster size distribution in standard percolation theory and avalanches in self-organized criticality. But when the network is highly connected, cascade propagation is limited instead by the local stability of the nodes themselves, and the size distribution of cascades is bimodal, implying a more extreme kind of instability that is correspondingly harder to anticipate. In the first regime, where the distribution of network neighbors is highly skewed, it is found that the most connected nodes are far more likely than average nodes to trigger cascades, but not in the second regime. Finally, it is shown that heterogeneity plays an ambiguous role in determining a system's stability: increasingly heterogeneous thresholds make the system more vulnerable to global cascades; but an increasingly heterogeneous degree distribution makes it less vulnerable.},

(2006) and the recently developed recursive unit root tests of Phillips et al. (2011) and Phillips et al. (2015). Our results demonstrate that all regional house prices have experienced episodes of explosive dynamics in the late 1980s and in the early and mid-2000s that cannot be explained by movements in the economic fundamentals. This finding suggests that non-fundamental factors, such as rational asset price bubbles, have played a role in the dynamics of the UK regional housing markets in the past. This conclusion is particularly important, considering the increased concern of the housing market observers about the future behaviour of commercial and residential property prices in the country.},

From 1 April 2013, second homes may be charged 100{\%} of their normal rate of council tax, instead of the previous maximum of 90{\%}. " Unoccupied and substantially unfurnished " properties will be subject to a discount of anything between 0{\%} and 100{\%} of their council tax, at the discretion of the billing authority. Properties undergoing " major repair work " or " structural alteration " , which are vacant, will be subject to a discount of any amount between 0{\%} and 100{\%}, for a maximum of 12 months. The full 50{\%} discount must be retained on a second home where the liable person is required as part of his/her employment to live in job-related accommodation. The current provisions date from 2004, when English local authorities were given discretion to set the discount on second homes and long-term empty dwellings at levels lower than the original 50{\%}. The discount on second homes could be set at between 10{\%} and 50{\%}. The discount on homes which have been unoccupied and substantially unfurnished for more than six months could be set at between 0{\%} and 50{\%}. From 1 April 2013, local authorities may also set an 'empty homes premium' for long-term empty properties. Properties which have been unoccupied and substantially unfurnished for over two years may be charged up to 150{\%} of the normal liability. This is a new provision.

We consider 11 combination algorithms (three variants of arithmetic averaging, four regression based, one performance based method and three forecasting techniques used in the machine learning literature) and two selection schemes. Through comprehensive analysis of two case studies developed from public data (Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2014 and ISO New England), we demonstrate that combing sister forecasts outperforms the benchmark methods significantly in terms of forecasting accuracy measured by Mean Absolute Percentage Error. With the power to improve accuracy of individual forecasts and the advantage of easy generation, combining sister load forecasts has a high academic and practical value for researchers and practitioners alike.},

abstract = {We live in a modern world supported by large, complex networks. Examples range from financial markets to communication and transportation systems. In many realistic situations the flow of physical quantities in the network, as characterized by the loads on nodes, is important. We show that for such networks where loads can redistribute among the nodes, intentional attacks can lead to a cascade of overload failures, which can in turn cause the entire or a substantial part of the network to collapse. This is relevant for real-world networks that possess a highly heterogeneous distribution of loads, such as the Internet and power grids. We demonstrate that the heterogeneity of these networks makes them particularly vulnerable to attacks in that a large-scale cascade may be triggered by disabling a single key node. This brings obvious concerns on the security of such systems. Complex networks are an essential part of a modern so-ciety ͓1,2͔. It has been shown that many networks, such as the World Wide Web ͑WWW͒, the Internet, and electrical power grids, present a surprisingly small average distance between nodes and a highly organized distribution of links per node ͓3–5͔. Generally, the average distance will not be affected by the removal of a random subset of nodes, but it will increase significantly if the removed nodes are among the most connected ones ͓3͔ ͑see also Refs. ͓6–8͔͒. The ex-istence of a giant connected component in the network, how-ever, does not depend on the presence of highly connected nodes. For instance, the WWW has homepages with many thousands of hyperlinks and can remain well connected after the removal of all homepages with five or more hyperlinks ͓9͔. In addition, the giant component itself is typically a small-world network ͓10͔ even after the removal of all highly connected nodes ͓11͔. These pioneering studies on network security address mainly static properties, i.e., the effect of different network architectures. They suggest that the net-work connectivity, and hence its functionability, is robust against random failure of nodes ͓3,6,7͔ and to some extent is even robust against intentional attacks ͓9,11͔. Here we show that for many physical networks, the removal of nodes can have a much more devastating consequence when the intrin-sic dynamics of flows of physical quantities in the network is taken into account. In a power transmission grid, for in-stance, each node ͑power station͒ deals with a load of power. The removal of nodes, either by random breakdown or inten-tional attacks, changes the balance of flows and leads to a global redistribution of loads over all the network. This can trigger a cascade of overload failures ͓12,13͔, as the one that happened on August 10, 1996 in the western United States power grid ͓14,15͔. Another example is the Internet ͓16 –18͔, where the load represents the amount of information a node ͑router͒ is requested to transmit per unit of time, and over-loads correspond to congestion ͓19͔. Internet collapses caused by congestion have been reported since its very be-ginning ͓20͔. In this Rapid Communication, we introduce a model for cascading failure in complex networks and show that it is applicable to realistic networks such as the Internet and power grids. For a given network, suppose that at each time step one unit of the relevant quantity, which can be information, en-ergy, etc., is exchanged between every pair of nodes and transmitted along the shortest path connecting them. The load at a node is then the total number of shortest paths passing through the node ͓21–23͔. The capacity of a node is the maximum load that the node can handle. In man-made networks, the capacity is severely limited by cost. Thus, it is natural to assume that the capacity C j of node j is propor-tional to its initial load L j ,},

In addition, the empirical results are examined in order to identify any patterns that exist. The principal conclusion of this survey is that the theoretical basis is sound, but the econometric applications leave much to be desired. One consequence is that the literature has produced few empirical regularities. Another is that more studies using better estimation procedures and better data are needed before it can be safely argued that the composite commodity concept is replaced by the characteristics approach. {\textcopyright} 1985.},

abstract = {We present an analysis of the topological structure and static tolerance to errors and attacks of the September 2003 actualization of the Union for the Coordination of Transport of Electricity (UCTE) power grid, involving thirty-three different networks. Though every power grid studied has exponential degree distribution and most of them lack typical small-world topology, they display patterns of reaction to node loss similar to those observed in scale-free networks. We have found that the node removal behavior can be logarithmically related to the power grid size. This logarithmic behavior would suggest that, though size favors fragility, growth can reduce it. We conclude that, with the ever-growing demand for power and reliability, actual planning strategies to increase transmission systems would have to take into account this relative increase in vulnerability with size, in order to facilitate and improve the power grid design and functioning.},

abstract = {The paper focuses on transnational wealth elites buying residential properties in New York and London as an investment rather than as a primary residence. The transnational wealth elite is a group of people that have their origin in one locality, but invest their wealth transnationally since they entertain transnational jobs, assets and social networks. New York and London real estate has the unique quality that it is perceived to be highly liquid, i.e. easily resold to other investors. Together with the safe haven and socio-cultural characteristics of both cities and the way the real estate market and its professionals are organised, global city residential real estate functions as a ‘safe deposit box'. The paper brings together different geographies: of the wealth elite, of offshore financial centres through which most real estate purchases are organised, and of real estate investment locations. It also maps the consequences of the safe deposit box function of real estate, in terms of not only house prices increases, but also of economic, social and cultural changes and how elite decision-making impacted this comprehensive set of changes in the fabric of the city. In doing this, the paper substantiates work on the financialisation of real estate by focussing attention on the agency of the wealth elite and their investment and legal networks rather than on property developers, housing associations or institutional investors.},

abstract = {The potential for cascading failure in power systems adds substantially to overall reliability risk. Monte Carlo sampling can be used with a power system model to estimate this impact, but doing so is computationally expensive. This paper presents a new approach to estimating the risk of large cascading blackouts triggered by multiple contingencies. The method uses a search algorithm (Random Chemistry) to identify blackout-causing contingencies, and then combines the results with outage probabilities to estimate overall risk. Comparing this approach with Monte Carlo sampling for two test cases (the IEEE RTS-96 and a 2383 bus model of the Polish system) illustrates that the new approach is at least two orders of magnitude faster than Monte Carlo, without introducing measurable bias. Moreover, the approach enables one to compute the sensitivity of overall blackout risk to individual component-failure probabilities in the initiating contingency, allowing one to quickly identify low-cost strategies for reducing risk. By computing the sensitivity of risk to individual initial outage probabilities for the Polish system, we found that reducing three line-outage probabilities by 50{\%} would reduce cascading failure risk by 33{\%}. Finally, we used the method to estimate changes in risk as a function of load. Surprisingly, this calculation illustrates that risk can sometimes decrease as load increases.},

abstract = {In order to identify the extent to which results from topological graph models are useful for modeling vulnerability in electricity infrastructure, we measure the susceptibility of power networks to random failures and directed attacks using three measures of vulnerability: characteristic path lengths, connectivity loss and blackout sizes. The first two are purely topological metrics. The blackout size calculation results from a model of cascading failure in power networks. Testing the response of 40 areas within the Eastern US power grid and a standard IEEE test case to a variety of attack/failure vectors indicates that directed attacks result in larger failures using all three vulnerability measures, but the attack vectors that appear to cause the most damage depend on the measure chosen. While our topological and power grid model results show some trends that are similar, there is only a mild correlation between the vulnerability measures for individual simulations. We conclude that evaluating vulnerability in power networks using purely topological metrics can be misleading.},

abstract = {In a cascading power transmission outage, component outages propagate non-locally; after one component outages, the next failure may be very distant, both topologically and geographically. As a result, simple models of topological contagion do not accurately represent the propagation of cascades in power systems. However, cascading power outages do follow patterns, some of which are useful in understanding and reducing blackout risk. This paper describes a method by which the data from many cascading failure simulations can be transformed into a graph-based model of influences that provides actionable information about the many ways that cascades propagate in a particular system. The resulting "influence graph" model is Markovian, since component outage probabilities depend only on the outages that occurred in the prior generation. To validate the model we compare the distribution of cascade sizes resulting from n-2 contingencies in a 2896 branch test case to cascade sizes in the influence graph. The two distributions are remarkably similar. In addition, we derive an equation with which one can quickly identify modifications to the proposed system that will substantially reduce cascade propagation. With this equation one can quickly identify critical components that can be improved to substantially reduce the risk of large cascading blackouts.},

abstract = {Our study investigates the role of speculation in real estate cycles. We find that even a simple model of lagged supply response to price changes and speculation is sufficient to generate real estate cycles. Second, the volatility of prices – the biggest purported downside of “speculation” – is strongly related to supply conditions. Even more interestingly, the effect of speculation itself depends on supply conditions. Markets with more responsive regulatory environments, or less natural constraint (from physical geography), will experience less volatility as well as less behavior characterized as speculation. Demand conditions in general, and speculation in particular, can contribute to a boom and bust cycle in housing and real estate markets – but the effects of speculation appear to be dominated by the effect of the price elasticity of supply. In fact, the largest effects of speculation are only observed when supply is inelastic. Thus effective policies will focus on improving the efficiency of the supply of developable land, and real estate generally, including the development of an appropriate regulatory framework for real estate.},

This study sheds some light on the nature of the property abandonment problem and on current city efforts to address it. It is based upon the findings of a survey of the 200 most populous central cities in the United States, conducted during the summer and fall of 1997, and on follow-up interviews with a portion of the survey population, conducted during the summer of 1998. The findings of the survey and interviews indicate that vacant and abandoned property is perceived as a significant problem by elected and appointed officials in the nation's largest central cities. This type of property affects many aspects of community life, including housing and neighborhood vitality, crime prevention efforts, and commercial district vitality. Single- and multi-family housing, retail properties and vacant land are the most problematic types of vacant and abandoned property for most cities. Cities use a variety of techniques to address this problem, including aggressive code enforcement, tax foreclosure, eminent domain, and cosmetic improvements. One-third of the cities surveyed use a variety of other innovative tools to combat the vacant and abandoned property problem. Nevertheless, current efforts to combat the problem suffer from a number of shortcomings that are described in the article.},

Different themes were studied in the collection, which includes planning aspects of second-home development, spatial modelling and predictive modelling and second homes as holiday accommodation (to name but three). Over the last 30 years, second-home research has blossomed, especially since the mid-1990s. Thus, we found it fitting to review the marked influence of this edited collection 30 years after the first conference was held that formed the basis of this book. Therefore, this article will investigate the relevance of the issues identified during the 1970s to issues surrounding present-day second-home tourism. The argument made in this article is that many of the issues that Coppock identified remain important today; however, many of the issues identified are less relevant to many second-home landscapes in both the developed and developing worlds.

@article{Gallent2017,
abstract = {Recombinant protein production processes are typically divided into two phases. In the first one, pure cell propagation takes place, while in the second one product formation is switched on within the cells by adding an inducer. In the initial biomass formation phase, the cell density is rather low and, hence, the measurement quantities that could be used to determine the process' state depict small values and are rather severely distorted by measurement noise. Because of these measurement problems, the fermentation cannot be reliably controlled by feedback control during this first production phase; instead, the process must be controlled in an open-loop fashion. The consequence, worked out in this paper, is to design substrate feed rate profiles for the growth phase in such a way that they are robust with respect to the main disturbances observed in practice. The robustness of the biomass formation is shown to be primarily dependent on the specific growth rate adjusted in the first hours. High batch-to-batch reproducibility can be obtained with exponential feeding profiles F(t) corresponding to specific growth rates micro(set) well below the maximal specific growth rate micro(max) of the organism. The reduction in the growth rate needed to obtain a robust process behavior depends on the inaccuracies in the initial biomass concentrations. Quantitative feed rate profiles were obtained by numerical simulation and these results were validated experimentally by means of a series of cultivation runs, where a recombinant pharmaceutical protein was produced. All experimental data confirmed the assumptions made in the robust process design study.},

The splitting method advances the simulation by stages, resampling from each stage to advance to the next stage. We apply the splitting method to the simulation of cascading blackouts to efficiently determine the probability distribution of blackout size. Testing on a blackout simulation shows that splitting can quickly compute large blackouts inaccessible to other methods.},
